# Kitchen Order Timing and Color System Guide

## Overview
The kitchen display system uses a color-coded timing system to help kitchen staff prioritize orders and maintain efficient service. Orders are automatically color-coded based on their age, and times are updated in real-time.

## Pending Orders Timing System

### Color Codes

| Time Range | Color | Priority Level |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 0-5 minutes | Gray | Normal |
| 5-10 minutes | Yellow | Attention Needed |
| 10-15 minutes | Orange | Urgent |
| Over 15 minutes | Red | Critical |

### Understanding the Colors

1. **Gray Background (0-5 minutes)**
   - Fresh orders that have just been placed
   - Normal priority
   - Regular preparation time

2. **Yellow Background (5-10 minutes)**
   - Orders are getting older
   - Should be in final preparation stages
   - Requires attention to avoid delays

3. **Orange Background (10-15 minutes)**
   - Urgent attention required
   - Orders are approaching critical time
   - Should be completing soon

4. **Red Background (Over 15 minutes)**
   - Critical priority
   - Orders have exceeded target preparation time
   - Immediate attention required

## Time Display System

### Pending Orders
- Shows how long ago the order was placed
- Updates automatically every second
- Format examples:
  - "Just now" (Less than 1 minute)
  - "1 minute ago"
  - "X minutes ago"

### Completed Orders
- Shows exact completion time
- 12-hour format (e.g., "2:30 PM")
- Sorted with most recent completions at the top

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring**
   - Check the display frequently
   - Pay attention to color changes
   - Prioritize orange and red orders

2. **Order Management**
   - Complete orders in order of arrival when possible
   - Prioritize older orders (orange/red)
   - Mark items as complete immediately when ready

3. **Time Management**
   - Aim to complete all orders before they turn orange
   - Use yellow warnings as action triggers
   - Communicate delays for red orders

4. **Completion Process**
   - Click items when completed
   - Verify all items are marked before final completion
   - Check completion times for performance tracking

## Tips for Kitchen Staff

1. **Start of Shift**
   - Check for any existing orders
   - Note current color status
   - Plan preparation sequence

2. **During Service**
   - Monitor color transitions
   - Anticipate upcoming color changes
   - Communicate with team about priorities

3. **Managing Multiple Orders**
   - Group similar items when possible
   - Prioritize based on both color and efficiency
   - Keep track of completion times

4. **Quality Control**
   - Don't rush red orders at expense of quality
   - Maintain standard preparation procedures
   - Communicate delays to management if needed

## Performance Metrics

- Target completion time: Under 15 minutes
- Ideal completion time: Under 10 minutes
- Warning threshold: 5 minutes
- Critical threshold: 15 minutes

Remember: The color system is a guide to help maintain efficient service while ensuring quality. Always prioritize food quality and safety while working to maintain timely service.
